a. What is an _issue_?
       An issue in GitHub is a tool used for tracking various aspects of a software development project, such as tasks, bugs, changes, and updates. It serves as a platform for managing work, receiving feedback, seeking help, and discussing ideas related to the project.

b. What is a _pull request_?
       A pull request (PR) allows you to propose changes to another project on GitHub. It enables you to inform others about the changes you've made in a branch of a repository. While creating a pull request, you're essentially suggesting changes, which may or may not be merged into the main branch of the repository.   
       c. How do I open up a _pull request_?
       To open a pull request, start by forking and cloning the repository you want to contribute to. Next, create a new branch and make your changes. Once you've progressed with your work, initiate a pull request by navigating to the "Pull requests" tab and selecting "Compare & pull request". Choose the base repository and branch, then click on "Create Pull Request" to submit your changes for review.   
       d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
     First, create a new repository in your GitHub account. Then, access the repository and navigate to "Settings" from the menu bar. In the left sidebar, select "Manage access", and in the middle of the page, locate the "Invite a collaborator" button. From there, you can search for and invite people by using their email addresses.   
     e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
      The main difference is that git is a version control system used for tracking changes in files, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management. In essence, Git is the technology, and GitHub is a service built on top of Git.   
      f. What does `git diff` do?
     git diff compares the current state of files in your working directory with their state in the staging area (index) or with a specific commit. It displays the line-by-line differences, highlighting additions (+) and deletions (-), allowing you to review the changes before staging or committing them.
